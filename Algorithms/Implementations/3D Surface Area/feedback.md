## Feedback Summary: 
  - **Amal Shehu** provided feedback that my function is too long, occupying nearly 50 lines. He suggested to break the code into smaller, more manageable functions with clear responsibilities. He also suggested to remove the numerous if conditions which are hard to read and understand by choosing an alternative logic.

## Implementation: 
  - **Splitting the Function**: I refactored the code to break it into smaller, more manageable functions with clear responsibilities. Each function now focuses on a specific part of the logic, making the code easier to understand.

  - **Reducing Conditional Statements**: I reviewed the conditional statements and replaced some of them with more concise and efficient logic. This not only makes the code shorter but also improves its readability.

  - **Eliminating Repetition**: I eliminated redundancy by reusing functions and variables where applicable. This reduces the need for duplicated code and makes the codebase more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).


## Contributors:
  I want to express my sincere gratitude to **Amal Shehu** for his invaluable feedback. He conducted a meticulous and thorough review of every line of my code, identifying valuable improvements that greatly enhance code readability and optimization. His expertise and insights have been instrumental in improving the quality of the code. .

## Impact: 
  After incorporating all the suggested improvements and changes, I have successfully reduced the length of the enitre program to nearly 20 lines while maintaining its functionality and readability. The code is now more concise and easier to maintain.
